# My_project

Steps to run this in VS code :

1. Navigate to File -> Preferences -> Settings.
2. Type cwd in search.
3. Choose Terminal > Integrated: Cwd settings.
4. Type the default path you want to set in the text block below (simply, no need for double hashes to escape)
5. No need for saving, It's automatic.
6. Restart VS Code.

Once the terminal path is set to your Python file, run it manually using "python file_name.py" and it would execute.
